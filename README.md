This project demonstrates the use of **SQL Joins**, **Subqueries**, and **Nested Queries** on a sample database of customers and their orders. The database was designed and executed using **MySQL Workbench**.

### âœ… SUBQUERIES
- **Scalar Subqueries** â€“ E.g., comparing values with average order amount.
- **Multi-row Subqueries** â€“ Using `IN` to fetch all ordering customers.
- **Correlated Subqueries** â€“ To get each customerâ€™s highest order.
- **EXISTS / NOT EXISTS** â€“ For checking order existence.

### âœ… NESTED QUERIES
- Used to find customers in the same city as the top spender by nesting multiple subqueries.

## ðŸ’» Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench** for writing, executing, and managing the SQL queries.
